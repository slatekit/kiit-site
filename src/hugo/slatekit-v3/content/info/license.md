# Apache 2.0
The license for Slate Kit Framework Apache 2.0. 

# SAAS
There are some SAAS tools ( **independent from Slate Kit** ), that we are working on.
These are related to Cloud Services, and API tools, which we also are planning on open-sourcing.
The license for the open-source SAAS tools will be BSL 1.1

<!--
# Dual License
Slate Kit has a unique Dual License approach using BSL (Business Source License) and Apache 2.0 using the Additional Use Grants parameter of the BSL. 
This is a reletively new approach and license that we are trying out and we plan to improve on this dual licensing approach in time.
Currently, we are allowing this software to be used as Apache 2.0 immediately for the groups / usage listed below and for the foreseeable future.

# Apache 2.0
This is effectively Apache 2.0 for the following groups and usage

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <tr><td><strong>Non-Profits</strong></td><td> Non-Profit institutions ( .org ) </td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Educational</strong></td><td>Educational institutions ( .edu ) </td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Startups</strong></td><td>Same as Commercial ( see below ) </td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Personal</strong></td><td>Personal projects for non-commercial use</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Commerical</strong></td><td>Must <strong>NOT</strong> be a Cloud Provider company and/or used for building Cloud-Provider infrastructure ( such as AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Digital Ocean, etc )</td></tr>
</table>

# BSL 1.1 
For Cloud-Providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Digital Ocean, etc, this is a BSL license. 
It can not be used for production usage without obtaining a license.
<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <tr><td><strong>Change Date</strong></td><td> <strong>Jan 1, 2024</strong> - Converts to Apache 2.0 on Jan 1, 2024</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Change License</strong></td><td><strong>Apache 2.0</strong> - Type of license this BSL will convert to</td></tr>

<h1 id="Notes">Notes</h1>
<p>
1. BSL is a relatively new license type. <br/>
2. BSL is technically <strong>NOT an open-source</strong> license but rather <strong>source available</strong> <br/>
3. BSL has parameters <strong>Change Date | Change License | Additional Use Grants</strong> that convert it to open source <br/>
4. BSL Additional Use Grant is used to grant additional rights ( we are using this broadly to provide Apache 2.0 licensing rights above )<br/>
